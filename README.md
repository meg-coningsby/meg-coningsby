### Hi there, I'm Megan. ðŸ‘‹

With 15 years in marketing, including the last 4 in the exciting world of tech marketing, I've recently made the leap into software engineering. Why? Because I wanted to get my hands dirty with the "how" of tech and actually build the products I used to promote. I love being in the tech industry and making a difference every day. Now, I get to blend my new programming chops with my marketing and customer insights to create solutions that really click with users. Itâ€™s a thrilling new chapter, and I couldnâ€™t be more excited!

I have just completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (you can see my four projects from the course here in GitHub) and I am starting as a Junior Developer for ClearXP, a Melbourne-based tech company. 

I am always open to conversations, you can reach me: [meganconingsby+git@gmail.com](mailto:meganconingsby+git@gmail.com)
