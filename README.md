### Hi there, I'm Megan. ðŸ‘‹

I'm tech-savvy marketer turned software engineer, blending a mix of marketing mojo with coding finesse. 

After 15 years in Marketing, I recently made the switch to software engineering and I am excited to dive back into the tech world.

I have just completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (you can see my four projects from the course here in GitHub) and I am starting as a Junior Developer for a Melbourne-based tech company shortly. 

I am always open to conversations, you can reach me: [meganconingsby+git@gmail.com](mailto:meganconingsby+git@gmail.com)
