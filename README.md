### Hi there, I'm Megan. 👋

With 15 years in marketing, including the last 4 in tech marketing, I've recently made the leap into software engineering. Why? Because I wanted to get my hands dirty with the "how" of tech and actually build the products I used to promote. Now, I get to blend my new programming chops with my marketing and customer insights to create solutions that really click with users. 

I completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (you can see my four projects from the course here in GitHub) and I am starting as a Junior Software Engineer at [Genero](https://genero.com/).
